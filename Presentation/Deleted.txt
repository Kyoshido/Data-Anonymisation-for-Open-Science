## Motivation

- Legal frameworks regulate what is allowed and what is not allowed with regard to publication of private information.

- Before sensitive statistical databases can be made available to universities for research, confidentiality must be guaranteed.

- Users of statistical outputs should be aware of the reasoning and methodology behind statistical disclosure control.
