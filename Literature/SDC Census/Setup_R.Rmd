## Install R

Install latest version of R (at least 3.6.3) under https://cran.r-project.org/. Follow the instructions depending on your Operating System (Windows, Mac, Linux).

*Optionally but recommended*: If you are using Windows try to install Rtools https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/history.html. For R Version 3.6.3 install Rtools35, for R Version 4.0.1 and above install Rtools40. 

## Install RStudio

Install RStudio under https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download. RStudio is the most popular integrated development environment (IDE) used for R.

## Open RStudio and install packages

Running RStudio should open a window similar to the picture below. The area bounded by the red square shows the console where lines of code can be executed. A Cheat Sheet for RStudio can be downloaded here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/rstudio-ide.pdf

In order to install the needed packages run the following lines of code in the console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# run this Code to install needed packages
install.packages(c("data.table","devtools","R.utils","sdcTable","sdcMicro","sdcHierarchies","remotes"))

# install recordSwapping
devtools::install_github("sdcTools/recordSwapping", force=TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE, build_opts=c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"))
# install ptable
devtools::install_github("sdcTools/ptable", dependencies=c("Depends","Imports"), force=TRUE, build_opts="--build-vignettes")
# install cellKey
remotes::install_github(repo = "sdcTools/cellKey", dependencies = TRUE, build_opts = "--no-resave-data", force = TRUE)
```


### If you cannot install Rtools and subsequently `devtools`

If you cannot install `devtools` because Rtools is not available then you will not be able to install paackages from github. You can install a package directly using each of the source files

- `recordSwapping_1.0.1.tar.gz`
- `ptable_0.3.4.tar.gz`
- `cellKey_0.19.1.tar.gz`

They should have been send with this document. Run the following Code in the `Console` where `path/to/the/File/` is the path to folder where the files are saved.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install recordSwapping
install.packages("path/to/the/File/recordSwapping_1.0.1.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source")

# install ptable
install.packages("path/to/the/File/ptable_0.3.4.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source")

# install cellKey
install.packages("path/to/the/File/cellKey_0.19.1.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source")
```
