## Overview

- Targeted Record Swapping (TRS) in general

- Details on algorithm

- Information loss and risk


## Targeted Record Swapping

- Data-swapping technique applied on micro data

- TRS: Swap households across administrative/geographic regions    

- Use TRS as pre-tabular method applied on micro data

    - apply on micro data -> build table


```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%",out.height="5%"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("switch1.png","Table_2.png"))
``` 


## Targeted Record Swapping

- **Targeted** Record Swapping: **target** "high risk" households

- High risk $\rightarrow$ small frequency counts of individuals on a set of key variables (usually)

    - Geographic hierarchy x risk variables 
    - k-anonymity in our algorithm

- Household at high risk $\leftrightarrow$ individual at high risk


## Swap households

- Determine swap rate of $p\in[0,1]$

- Iterate through geographic regions / geographic hierarchies

- Sample households according to risk 

    - Sample household in geographic region
    - Sample donor household outside current geographic region

- Swap geographic variables between households

## Swap households - calculate risk

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Swap_demo1.png")
```

## Swap households - select high risk

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Swap_demo2.png")
```

## Swap households - select donor 

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Swap_demo3.png")
```
## Swap households - make swap

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Swap_demo4.png")
```

## Swap households

- Advantage of swapping whole households

    - Household structure preserved $\rightarrow$ no "impossible" households
    - Preserves marginal distributions (on higher geogr. levels)


## Details on algorithm

- Before applying the algorithm define certain parameter

- Geographic hierarchy (NUTS1, NUTS2, NUTS3,...)

- Swap rate $p\in[0,1]$

- Risk variables

- Threshold for high risk households  

    - currently k-anonymity rule
    - Individual (respectively household) *at risk* if $\sim counts < k$

- Optional but recommended:
  
    - similarity variables
    - "carry along" variables


## Details on algorithm

1. Calculate total number of swaps given swap rate $p$%
2. Estimate risk $r_{i,h}$ through k-anonymity rule for each individual $i$ in geographic hierarchy ($h$) using risk variables $v_1,\ldots,v_p$ with individual $i$ living in area $g_1$ and $N_{g_1}$ as the number of persons in $g_1$

$$
r_{i,h} = (\sum\limits_{j=1}^{N_{g_1}}1[v_{1(i)}=v_{1(j)} \land ... \land v_{p(i)}=v_{p(j)}])^{-1}
$$

$$
r_{i,h} \sim \frac{1}{counts}
$$

## Details on algorithm

3. Risk of household $y$, $R_{y,h}$, is then defined by the maximum of risk across all household member

$$
R_{y,h} = \max_{i\text{ in household }y}(r_{i,h})
$$




## Details on algorithm

4. Determine "high risk" households which will definitely be swapped in each geographic hierarchy

5. Iterate the geographic hierarchies (from top to bottom)

    - NUTS1 $\rightarrow$ NUTS2 $\rightarrow$ NUTS3 $\rightarrow\ \ldots$ 

6. In each geographic area sample households by probability (~risk) and swap them

7. At lowest hierarchy distribute number of swaps left to reach swap rate $p$

    - distributed proportional to cumulative risk
    - swaprate only lower bound on number of swaps

## Detials on algorithm - swaps distributed

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("diagram.png")
```

## Details on algorithm

- Limitation:

    1. Each variable in the data must be type integer (~ max 9 digits)
    2. Same C++ code in R and Argus still slightly different results due to RNG
    3. Risk only calculated through $\frac{1}{counts}$
    

- Package is continously developed further $\rightarrow$ might be improved in future releases

## "Similarity" variables

- Control swapping further with "similarity" variable

- Variables on which the swapped households must agree on

    - for instance: household size, tenancy, ...
    
- Preserves marginal distributions of some variables    

## "Similarity" variables

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Swap_similar.png")
```


## "Carry along" variables

- Variables which are swaped in addition to geographic variables (NUTS1, NUTS2, ...) but do *NOT* influence swaping procedure.

- Usually very detailed geographic variables like grid cells (1km, 500m, ...)

    - Must be household variables

- If one does not swap additional variables resulting micro data will have "strange" values

## "Carry along" variables

|   PID   |    NUTS1           |  NUTS2    |  NUTS3 | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|--:| 
| 1      | AT1      | AT13   |  AT130  |
| 2      | AT2      |   AT21 |  AT121  |

## Information loss and risk

- After TRS was applied build frequency tables and calculate statistics on information loss

- Information loss is derived by differences between cells of unperturbed $D_o(c)$ and perturbed data $D_p(c)$

- Following metrics are recommended

    - Absolute deviation $|D_o(c) - D_p(c)|$
    - Relative absolute deviation  $\frac{|D_o(c) - D_p(c)|}{D_o(c)}$
    - Absolute difference of square roots $|\sqrt{D_o(c)} - \sqrt{D_p(c)}|$


## Information loss and risk

- 
- Summary statistics (per geographic region $k$ for instance)


- $AD(k,c) = |D^k_o(c) - D^k_p(c)|$ $\rightarrow$ $\overline{AD(k)} := \frac{\sum\limits_{c\in k} AD(k,c)}{n_k}$
- $RAD(k,c) = \frac{|D^k_o(c) - D^k_p(c)|}{D^k_o(c)}$ $\rightarrow$ $\Sigma_{RAD}(k):=\sum\limits_{c\in k} RAD(k,c)$
- $D_R(k,c)= |\sqrt{D^k_o(c)} - \sqrt{D^k_p(c)}|$ $\rightarrow$ $HD(k):=\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\sum\limits_{c\in k} D_R(k,c)^2}$


## Information loss and risk

|   SEX / NUTS1    | 1           | 2    | 3 |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|--:|
| 1      | 6842      | 2962   |  5503  |
| 2      | 6815      |   2857 |  5599  |
 
 
|   SEX / NUTS1    | 1           | 2    | 3 |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|--:|
| 1      | 6810      | 3011   |  5486  |
| 2      | 6806      |   2886 |  5579  |
 

## Information loss and risk

|   SEX / NUTS1    | 1           | 2    | 3 |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|--:|
| 1      | 32      | -49   |  17  |
| 2      | 9      |   -29 |  20  |


$$
\overline{AD(1)} = \frac{|6842-6810|+|6815-6806|}{2} = \frac{|32|+|9|}{2} = 20.5
$$

$$
\overline{AD(2)} = \frac{|-49|+|-29|}{2} = 39
$$

## Information loss and risk

$$
\overline{AD(3)} = \frac{|17|+|20|}{2} = 18.5
$$

- Aggregated value over $AD(1),AD(2),AD(3)$

$$
\frac{1}{3}\sum\limits_{k=1}^3AD(k) = 25.83
$$


## Information loss and risk

- Can also calculate $AD$, $RAD$ and $D_R$ and analyse distribution

    - 5 number summary
    - Cumulative distribution
    - Percentiles


- Risk: Protection from TRS given by the uncertainty of the values of the table cells

    - minimum swap determines amount of uncertainty
    - TRS actually used to protect micro data, now applied as pre-tabular method

## Overview workflow

- For Census 2021 tables apply TRS once on the micro data

- Use moderately low swap rate (1%-5%)

- Use similarity variables to control swaps

- After TRS was applied go on to:
    
    - Use micro data with swapped households to generate different census tables
      
        - Calculate statistics on information loss 

    - Apply cell-key method on created tables
