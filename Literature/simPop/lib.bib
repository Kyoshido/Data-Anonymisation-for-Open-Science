abstract="Image classification has become an important area of research in remote sensing. In this paper, the algorithms Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) are used to classify compact polarimetric (CP) RISAT-1 cFRS mode data for land cover categorisation over Mumbai region. After preprocessing, Raney decomposition technique was applied to obtain the R, G, B channels of the image. Hyperparameter tuning of ANN was also performed to get the optimal parameters for the classification. Comparative analysis showed that both the algorithms showed almost equal performance on the data in terms of accuracy. However, there was only 1{\%} of the increment found in both the train and test the accuracy of XGBoost classifier. ANN method required tuning, and thus it requires more time for computation while XGBoost algorithm works well without any tuning and thus, XGBoost outperforms the image classification task for CP RISAT-1 data than ANN.",

abstract="Differential privacy has recently emerged as one of the strongest privacy guarantees by making few assumptions on the background or external knowledge of an attacker. Differentially private data analysis and publishing have received considerable attention in biomedical communities as promising approaches for sharing medical and health data, while preserving the privacy of individuals represented in data records. In this chapter, we provide a broad survey of the recent works in differentially private histogram and synthetic data publishing. We categorize most recent and emerging techniques in this field from two major aspects: (a) various data types (e.g, relational data, transaction data, dynamic stream data, etc.), and (b) parametric, and non-parametric techniques. We also present some challenges and future research directions for releasing differentially private histogram and synthetic data in health and medical data.",
